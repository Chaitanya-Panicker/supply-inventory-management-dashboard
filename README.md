# 📦 Inventory & Supply Chain Dashboard

## 📖 Project Overview  
Efficient supply chain management is the heartbeat of any successful business. This project visualizes **inventory, transportation, and warehouse utilization data** to uncover insights that help decision-makers optimize operations, reduce costs, and boost customer satisfaction.  

With a dynamic Power BI dashboard, we track everything from **transportation costs** to **inventory turnover**, providing a clear roadmap for operational improvements.

## 🔍 Key Visualizations  
- **Avg Transportation Cost** — Identify high-cost product categories.  
- **Avg Lead Time** — Measure speed from order to delivery.  
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio** — Gauge efficiency of stock movement.  
- **Warehouse Utilization Rate** — Optimize storage capacity.  
- **Lead Time by Category** — Spot delays in specific product lines.  
- **Units Sold (Overall & by Year)** — Track sales performance over time.  
- **Backorder Status** — Monitor order fulfillment efficiency.  
- **Transportation Cost by Category** — Target cost-reduction opportunities.  
- **Inventory Level by Category** — Balance stock levels across products.

- **Inventory turnover ratio is 24.91**, indicating a strong stock movement rate.  
- **Warehouse utilization is only 35.48%**, suggesting underused capacity.  
- **714K units sold** with peak sales in **2022**, followed by a slight decline in 2023.  
- **Fulfilled orders dominate backorders**, but pending and canceled orders need monitoring.  
- **Electronics** hold the highest inventory level, indicating possible overstocking.
